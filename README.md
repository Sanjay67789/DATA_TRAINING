MACHINE LEARNING - Multi-Recursion Training
Description
This repository is for personal practice in machine learning, specifically focusing on multi-recursion. It contains a simple Python script and a dataset in CSV format. The aim is to experiment and learn, so the content is kept straightforward.

Files

  PROGRAM FILE :
                water_plant_treatment.py: A Python script demonstrating recursion within a machine learning context.
  
  
  DATASET FILE :
                W_P_T_DATASET.csv: The dataset used for testing the recursion concepts.
How to Use

Clone the repository:
  bash
    Copy code
      git clone https://github.com/sanjayk67789/DATA_TRAINING.git
Run the script:
  bash
    Copy code
      python water_plant_treatment1.py
The script will load the data.csv file and perform basic recursive operations related to machine learning. You can modify it as needed to experiment with different approaches.

Notes

This repository is purely for practice. Donâ€™t worry about mistakes or random code experiments found here.
The instructions are kept minimal for simplicity. Everything is easy to run and tweak!
